# 🚨 SECURITY FIX REQUIRED

## Issue Found
Your OpenAI API key was hardcoded in the source code, which is a major security vulnerability.

## ✅ What I Fixed
1. **Removed hardcoded API key** from `essayassist.py`
2. **Updated code** to use only environment variables
3. **Created template** for secure API key management

## 🔧 What You Need To Do

### Step 1: Create Environment File
```bash
# Copy the template
cp env_template.txt .env

# Edit the .env file with your actual API key
nano .env
```

### Step 2: Add Your API Key
In the `.env` file, replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
```

### Step 3: Secure Your Repository
```bash
# Add .env to .gitignore (if not already there)
echo ".env" >> .gitignore

# If you've already committed the secret, you need to:
# 1. Revoke the exposed API key in OpenAI dashboard
# 2. Generate a new API key
# 3. Update your .env file with the new key
```

### Step 4: Test the Application
```bash
# Make sure the app still works
python3 application.py
```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for all secrets
3. **Add .env to .gitignore** to prevent accidental commits
4. **Rotate API keys** if they've been exposed
5. **Use different keys** for development and production

## 🔍 How to Get a New API Key

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Click "Create new secret key"
3. Copy the new key
4. Update your `.env` file
5. **Delete the old key** from OpenAI dashboard

## ⚠️ If You've Already Committed This

If you've already pushed this code to GitHub:
1. **Immediately revoke** the exposed API key
2. **Generate a new key** 
3. **Update your code** with the new key
4. **Consider the old key compromised**

Your application will now be secure! 🔒
